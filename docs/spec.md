# Team Builder - Project Specification

## ðŸ§¾ Purpose

Create a portable, reproducible Python-based tool to assign balanced youth soccer teams based on skill scores, coach assignments, and team size constraints.

## ðŸ§± Requirements

### Inputs

- `players.csv`: CSV file with player data.

  - Must include:
    - `PlayerID`: unique player ID
    - `Player Name`: first and last name
    - `Date Of Birth`: MM/DD/YYYY (used to compute age with 1 decimal precision)
    - `Years of Experience`: integer; column header may be suffixed (use the first matching prefix)
    - `Uniform Size Selection`: categorical size value; header may be suffixed (use the first matching prefix)
    - `Player Evaluation Ranking`: skill score (format currently unknown)
    - `sponsor_id`: optional sponsor identifier

- `coaches.csv`: CSV file with coach data.

  - Must include:
    - `VolunteerID`: coach ID
    - `Team Personnel Name`: full name (first and last)
    - `Team Personnel Role`: "Head Coach" or "Assistant Coach" (ignore others)
    - `associatedPlayers`: linked player ID if available; values like "No Answer" mean none
    - `Coach Pair`: ID of paired coach (both coaches must reference each other to form a valid pair)
    - `VolunteerTypeID`:  included in output

### Command-line Arguments

- `--players path/to/players.csv`
- `--coaches path/to/coaches.csv`
- `--team-size 7`

### Outputs

- `team_assignments.csv` written to the current working directory
  - Contains multiple rows per team, one per Coach and Player assigned to that team
    - Coach rows include: `TeamName`, `VolunteerID`, `VolunteerTypeID`, `Team Personnel Name`, `Team Personnel Role`
    - Player rows include: `TeamName`, `PlayerID`, `Player Name`
- `team_summary.csv`Â written to the current working directory
  - Contains one row per team with: `team name`, `number of players`, `total skill score`, `sponsor_id` (if any)

### Constraints

- Parse players first and build full player pool
- Parse coaches and create head/assistant pools
- Form teams from:
  - Reciprocated pairings (both coaches list each other in `Coach Pair`)
  - Unpaired head coaches, randomly matched with unpaired assistant coaches
    - Prioritize pairing coaches without an associated player with those who do have one
- Each team includes:
  - One required head coach
  - One optional assistant coach
  - One or more players
  - At most one sponsored player
  - Cumulative skill score of all players on the roster
  - Team name format:
    - `<Head Last Name>` (if solo)
    - `<Head Last Name>/<Assistant Last Name>` (if both present)
- Greedy distribution of remaining players:
  - Prioritize teams with lowest skill score
  - Break ties using fewest players, then randomly
  - Skip teams that already have a sponsor when assigning sponsored players
  - Enforce minimum team size before expanding
  - After minimums are met, no team may exceed the smallest team by more than one player

## ðŸ§© Data Models

### `Player`

- `player_id: str`
- `name: str` (full name)
- `dob: str` (MM/DD/YYYY)
- `age: float` (computed from DOB, 1 decimal precision, half-up rounding)
- `experience: int`
- `uniform_size: str`
- `evaluation_score: str` (raw format, possibly numeric)
- `sponsor_id: Optional[str]`

### `Coach`

- `coach_id: str`
- `full_name: str`
- `role: str` ("Head Coach" or "Assistant Coach")
- `associated_player_id: Optional[str]`
- `pair_id: Optional[str]` (referenced `VolunteerID` of intended pair)
- `volunteer_type_id: Optional[str]` (used for output formatting)

### `Team`

- `team_id: str`
- `name: str` (e.g. "Smith/Jones" or "Smith")
- `head_coach: Coach`
- `assistant_coach: Optional[Coach]`
- `players: List[Player]`
- `sponsor_id: Optional[str]`
- `total_score: float`

## ðŸ§Š GitHub Actions Build

Located at `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

- Builds both Windows and macOS executables
- Uses PyInstaller to generate:
  - `team_builder.exe` for Windows
  - `team_builder` for macOS
- Artifacts are uploaded for download via GitHub UI
